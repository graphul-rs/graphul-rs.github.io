Graphul is an extremely simple and powerful Rust web backend framework. Only basic Rust knowledge is required to develop backend services

## Quickreview

If you are thinking of building a web server Graphul is an amazing library to do it.

Graphul provides you with the basic tools to build a web server, we are talking about routing, sharing state system, pre-processing of requests and post-processing of responses.

We don't do it alone, we are re-using libraries as [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and we are giving you a better abstraction and more friendly interface.
