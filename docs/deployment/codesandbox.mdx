CodeSandbox is a free online editor that allows you to create web applications, from prototype to deployment. It’s a great tool for learning and prototyping, and it’s also a great tool for sharing your work with others. You can use CodeSandbox to create a website, a blog, a portfolio, or even a full-fledged web application.

[CodeSandbox currently supports Rust projects](https://codesandbox.io/blog/announcing-rust-support-in-codesandbox) including Graphul projects.

Although indeed, this doesn't work to use it for production, we will explain how to use it for a test or share your code.

## How to use CodeSandbox

To use CodeSandbox, you must first create an account. Once you have created an account, you can fork our template project:

import TemplateImage from './assets/graphul-template.png';
import CardForDocumentation from '@site/src/components/atoms/Cards/CardForDocumentation';

<CardForDocumentation image={TemplateImage} alt="A image of the README" title="Graphul Template" description="A template to use for projects in CodeSandbox" link="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/graphul-template-p9wm1y?file=%2FREADME.md" />
