## What's a request?

An HTTP request consists of a head and a potentially optional body. 

The body component is generic, enabling arbitrary types to represent the HTTP body.

## About the Graphul implementation

In Graphul the Req contains a [Generic Data Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html), for example, the body could be Vec<u8\>, a Stream of byte chunks, or a value that has been deserialized.

This struct is accessible in a middleware handler, Graphul reuses the [Request struct of Axum](https://docs.rs/http/0.2.8/http/request/struct.Request.html) 

### This struct implements the following methods:

| Method | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| body | &Body | Returns a reference to the associated HTTP body. |
| body_mut | &mut Body | Returns a mutable reference to the associated HTTP body. |
| extensions | &Extensions | Returns a reference to the associated extensions. |
| extensions_mut | &mut Extensions | Returns a mutable reference to the associated extensions. |
| headers | &HeaderMap | Returns a reference to the associated header field map. |
| headers_mut | &mut HeaderMap | Returns a mutable reference to the associated header field map. |
| into_body | Body | Consumes the request, returning just the body. |
| into_parts | (Parts, Body) | Consumes the request returning the head and body parts. |
| map | Request<U\> | Consumes the request returning a new request with body mapped to the return type of the passed in function. |
| method | &[Method](https://docs.rs/http/0.2.8/http/method/struct.Method.html) | Returns a reference to the associated HTTP method. |
| method_mut | &mut [Method](https://docs.rs/http/0.2.8/http/method/struct.Method.html) | Returns a mutable reference to the associated HTTP method. |
| uri | &Uri | Returns a reference to the associated URI. |
| uri_mut | &mut Uri | Returns a mutable reference to the associated URI. |
| version | Version | Returns the associated HTTP version. |
| version_mut | &mut Version | Returns a mutable reference to the associated HTTP version. |
