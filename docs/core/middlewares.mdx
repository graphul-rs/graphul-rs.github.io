## What is a Middleware?

Middlewares are one of the core features of the framework. They are the functions that are called when a request is received. They are responsible for processing the request and returning a response.

Typically, middleware is involved in the following actions:

- Pre-process the Request
- Post-process a Response
- Modify application state
- Access external services (Redis, Logging, Sessions)

## How to create a Middleware?

Middleware is created by implementing a function that has two parameters, one with type [Req](request) and the second one with type `Next`. 
These functions can be loaded in the instance of Graphul using the function `middleware` and calling the module function `middleware::from_fn`.

Something to understand it's that the order of loading of the middleware affects how the framework works.

For example:

```rust showLineNumbers
use graphul::{http::{Methods, response::Redirect, response::Response}, Graphul, middleware::{self, Next}, Req, IntoResponse};

async fn my_middleware( request: Req, next: Next ) -> Response {
  let Some(token) = request.headers().get("token") else {
    return Redirect::to("/login").into_response();
  };
  next.run(request).await
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let mut app = Graphul::new();

  app.get("/", || async {
      "hello world!"
  });
  app.middleware(middleware::from_fn(my_middleware));

  // routes out of the scope of the middleware
  app.get("/login", || async {
      "Login page"
  });

  app.run("127.0.0.1:8000").await;
}
```

This middleware only affects the first route, all routes added after loading the middleware on line 17 don't apply the middleware logic to them.
