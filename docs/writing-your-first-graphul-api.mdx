## Installing Rust

If you donâ€™t have Rust yet, we recommend you use `rustup` to manage your Rust installation. The [official rust guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) has a wonderful section on getting started.

Graphul currently has a minimum supported Rust version 1.60. Running `rustup update` will ensure you have the latest and greatest Rust version available. As such, this guide assumes you are running Rust 1.60 or later.

## Hello World!

Let's write our first Graphul application! Start by creating a new binary-based Cargo project and changing into the new directory:

```bash
cargo new hello-world
cd hello-world
```

### Add Graphul as a dependency

Add `graphul` as a dependency of your project by adding the following to your Cargo.toml file.

Besides we choose [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) as asynchronous Rust runtime for this example but you can use whatever you like.

So your `Cargo.toml` should have something like this.

```toml
[dependencies]
graphul = "0.4.5"
tokio = { version = "1.23.0", features = ["full"] }
```

:::tip
In the new versions of Rust you can run a command like this:
```
cargo add graphul tokio --features tokio/full
```

<details className="theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution alert alert--warning">
  <summary>For Graphul devs:</summary>


Development versions must be git dependencies.

To depend on a development version of Graphul, you'll need to point `Cargo.toml` to a Graphul git repository. 

```toml
[dependencies]
graphul = { git = "https://github.com/graphul-rs/graphul" }
```

</details>

### Editing `main.rs`

Copy and paste these few lines of code into the file main.rs, we are going to explain:

```rust title="src/main.rs" showLineNumbers
use graphul::{http::Methods, Graphul};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = Graphul::new();

    app.get("/", || async { "Hello, World ðŸ‘‹!" });

    app.run("127.0.0.1:8000").await;
}
``` 

In line 3 we found a [macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#procedural-macros-for-generating-code-from-attributes)!
```rust {1}
#[tokio::main]
```
In short `#[tokio::main]` initialize an async runtime.

This macro is from the library [Tokio](https://tokio.rs). We recommend reading [this article](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/hello-tokio#async-main-function) about the macro for more information.

In line 5 we instance Graphul and save it in the variable `app`.
```rust {1}
    let mut app = Graphul::new();
```
Then in line 7, we access a method of the variable `app` (The instance of Graphul). It is the method get.

Graphul provides a method for every [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

In this function/method of the variable, we need to pass two parameters 
```rust {1}
    app.get("/", || async { "Hello, World ðŸ‘‹!" });
```
The first is the access route and the second, is an executable function for when a request is going to be received.

In this case, we are using a [closure of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html) that return "Hello, World ðŸ‘‹!"

Finally, into line 9 we run the server in port 8000.

So if you understand this:

Congratulations!
Your first app has been done! Compile and run the program with `cargo run`.

You can go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or any of the other routes you defined to see the results.
